 <h1> Why Include States in This Program? </h1>

 <p>For many students, the location of the college they go to is very important. Whether it be to stay close to family or for climate preferences. We wanted to factor in the geographical restrictions students may have while selecting a college in the United States. Itâ€™s also important to keep in mind that the cost of attending an out-of-state college can be a lot higher than attending an in-state college. This is because most states subsidize the higher education of students who are residents of the state, which means you will pay lower tuition fees when attending an in-state college. So often for financial aid opportunities, students may want to stay in their home state. </p>

 <p> We were originally only going to allow a user to input in state at a time but we realized this might be restricting if they wanted to explore multiple states in a certain area. Now students can input as many states as they want and will receive the top college in the U.S. that fits their requirements. Students can also run the program multiple times for different states to see the top college in a particular state that fits their criteria. </p>
