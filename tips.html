    <ul>
      <li>Move to the T as fast as you can after every shot.</li>
      <li>Keep your eye on the ball.</li>
      <li>Move your opponent off the T (out of position).</li>
      <li>Hit 80% of your shots straight (parallel to the side wall).</li>
      <li>Take your time on your serve and try to hit the side wall.</li>
      <li>Focus on ONE point at a time.</li>
      <li>Never assume your shot is a winner and always be prepared for your opponent to retrieve it!</li>

  <h3>What You Can Do to Improve</h3>
  <div class="flexcontainer">
    <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Practice
        <ul>
          <li>Whether you're practicing alone or with your coach, repetition and discipline are how you get better! Drills are used to practice all of your skills, from serves to volleys! Another way to practice is by playing with other people. Ask some friends to get on court and play a few games with you! Remember: You only get out what you put in.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Challenge Yourself!
        <ul>
          <li>See how many shots you can hit against the wall in a row!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Footwork
        <ul>
          <li>Practice getting to the four corners and back to the T without a ball. This is called <a href="https://sportscentaur.com/the-complete-guide-to-squash-ghosting-drills/">"ghosting"</a>. It will help prepare you for a match when you need to retrieve all of your opponent's shots while staying in a position to control the rally.</li>
