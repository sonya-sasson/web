  <p>According to the <a href="https://www.worldsquash.org/">World Squash Federation</a>, squash has been around since 1830. The game originated from an older game called "rackets," which was played in London's prisons in the 18th century. Later, students at The Harrow School outside London discovered that a punctured ball played the same way made the game even more exciting. The first squash players used punctured rubber balls, which, when hit, squashed against the walls (hence the name "squash").</p>

    <p>Today, squash is played in the confinement of four walls between two players, each holding a racquet to strike a rubber ball against the front wall. The sport has gained popularity around the world and is now played in over 185 countries. Some professional tournaments are held at spectacular venues such as the Pyramids of Giza, Grand Central Station in New York City, and the Shanghai waterfront in China.</p>
