 <h1> Why Include Prices in This Program? </h1>

 <p>We included prices in our program to take into account various financial restrictions students may have. We wanted to match students to schools that are within their budget range. Of course, one drawback is that our program cannot take into consideration financial aid and scholarships, so there students may be able to afford more expensive schools even with a tighter budget if they qualify for such programs. Our program looks at the average cost of  a university but it is also important to keep in mind that some public universities may be less expensive for students from their state. Also, private institutions are generally more expensive than public ones. So while there certainly are various personal factors that come into play with the cost of the university, our program is helpful in giving students a ballpark for the average cost of the school. </p>
