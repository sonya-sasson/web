    <p>If you're a beginner, it can't hurt to try out different kinds of racquets. Some are heavier and some are lighter, and it'll definitely take some on-court experimentation to find out the best fit for you. A head-light squash racket is typically best for players who like to volley and flick the ball. Lighter racquets are usually best for players with a strong upper body, too. On the other hand, using a heavy racket allows you to add power to shots, making it easier for players to hit the ball harder with a larger swing.</p>
